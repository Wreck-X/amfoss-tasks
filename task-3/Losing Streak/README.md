input contains 2 integers n and m

theres two tables where his value becomes a third of what it was originally and a table where its half of what it was orginally

for joe to reach the predicted amount

he has to check whether the amount he has is perfectly divisible by the required amount he should have if not print -1 and ext

if it is divisible you prime factorise all the quotient and append the factors to a list

the given list should only have the number factors 2 and 3 as he only has the ability to divide by 2 or 3 otherwise 
joe will be unable to get to the required number

therefore i iterated over the list and checked if elements only contain 2 and 3 if not print -1 and exit

else print the sum of number of 2's and number of 3's as that would be equal to the number of rounds to be played
