by far the most difficult task in here

had difficulties in finding suitable documentation as it was either very much outdated or wasn't what i needed for this specific case

took some time but i managed to figure out how to actually alter the dom
as that was what i struggled with the most

then i ended up forgetting to build the code before testing it out on the port... wasted one day on a program that was already working 

but eh figured it out in the end.

also i used a package called godom which made it easier to access the dom it can be installed with this

GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js go get -u github.com/siongui/godom/wasm
