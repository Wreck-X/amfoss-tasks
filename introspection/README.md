Why must we choose you?

->I myself am not sure what my worth is, but all i know for certain is that i am willing to do anything and everything to learn anything thats interesting to me. I shall also try and develop the club in anyway possible and hopefully make it a better version of what it is currently.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

if i get into the club:
-> hopefully improve my coding and to get a grasp on develepment and try and get to contribute to y a good open source project that im interested in.
-> try not to fail my exams
-> have fun altogether

else:
-> try not to fail my exams
-> get into someother club till i can try again another time

How would you contribute back to the club? 

-> once im good enough start a project that im invested in
-> contribute to opensource
-> during my senior years provide mentorship to others

Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

-> was fun all the way no changes needed.
